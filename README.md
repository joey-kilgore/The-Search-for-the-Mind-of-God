# The Search for the Mind of God
 
This repo is for a book I'm working on writing. As a believer in Christ Jesus and the resurection, as well as an academic, I wanted to write about how I see both worlds. A lot of work has been an academic defense of Christianity, but I think a different discussion needs to be had. Defending Christianity is certainly part of the battle, but I think we need an open discussion on why you would consider Christianity in the first place. I believe there is something more than a logical proof that will lead to a conclusion of the saving grace of God, and hopefully I can express that to others.  
Additionally, I hope to have each side (Christians and Academics) see the opposing side for what they truly are, and be willing to look critically at themselves. Neither side is perfect, and neither side is good at acknowledging they aren't perfect.
